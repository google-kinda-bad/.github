## Google Kinda Bad

Google is kinda bad at designing APIs for us. We make it better.

What we do:
```python
map(), filter(), max()
```

1. **Map**. Locate our needs and where we are.
2. **Filter**. Filter all of the data. This applies to our values and Google's data fetched.
3. **Max**. Maximize output. More options, more control.
